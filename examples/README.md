# Examples
This folder contains examples for working and running experiments with the library. Make sure to import and run these functions in the main file (from the top-level directory).

## Tutorial
To get started, see `tutorial.py`.

## Experimental Examples
### Benchmarking
To try out benchmarking code, see `benchmarking.py`.

### MI Trends
To explore changes in MI as methodology is tweaked, see `mi_trends.py`.

### Visualisation
To produce pretty pictures and get up close to models, see `visualisation.py`.

### Genetic Analysis
To analyse results found from a previous genetic algorithm run, see `genetic_analysis.py`.

### Optimisation
To optimise an arbitrary model's weights for maximum MI, see `optimisation.py`.
